### How It Works
1. **Upload PDFs:** Users can upload multiple PDF files through the user-friendly interface.
2. **Process PDFs:** The app extracts text from the uploaded PDFs and processes it to create text chunks.
3. **Ask Questions:** Users can input questions related to the content of the uploaded PDFs.
4. **Get Answers:** The app uses AI models to find and display answers based on the PDF content.

## Technologies Used

### Streamlit
- **Purpose:** Streamlit is a framework for building interactive web applications in Python.
- **Usage:** Creates the user interface, allowing users to upload PDF files and interact with the application.

### Google Generative AI
- **Purpose:** Provides advanced AI capabilities, including text generation and embeddings.
- **Usage:** Generates embeddings and conversational models to understand and answer user questions based on PDF content.

### Langchain
- **Purpose:** Framework for building applications with language models.
- **Usage:** Creates and manages conversational chains, integrating AI models to process and answer queries.

### PyPDF2
- **Purpose:** Library for reading and manipulating PDF files in Python.
- **Usage:** Extracts text from uploaded PDF files for processing.

### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Purpose:** Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Usage:** Stores and retrieves text embeddings for fast and accurate similarity searches on PDF text chunks.

### langchain_google_genai
- **Purpose:** Integration between Langchain and Google Generative AI.
- **Usage:** Leverages Google Generative AIâ€™s embedding and conversational capabilities within the Langchain framework.
